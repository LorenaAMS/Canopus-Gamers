          <h1>Historia</h1>
        <p>In 2012, Peter Delacour (voiced by Troy Baker), a master thief and alien conspiracist, 
            is hired to steal an ancient Egyptian artifact called the Book of Khnemu for his client: network
             maven Emilio Chauncey (voiced by Josh Gad). However, once he gives it to him, Chauncey, wanting to 
             use the book's power to take over the world, tells his bodyguards to get rid of any evidence, including
              Delacour. Peter narrowly escapes when it looks like a street gang engages Chauncey's men in a 
              firefight with strange weapons. Chauncey gets away and shortly after, the MiB show up. Agent C 
              (voiced by Laura Bailey), a MiB desk clerk, and Frank the Pug takes Delacour into custody and uses 
              an MiB car in hyper drive mode to get Peter back to MiB headquarters for questioning. After 
              interrogation, Delacour tries to stealthily escape MiB headquarters, but is caught. With the fact 
              that J and K went missing on the same investigation and the fact that Chauncey is apparently helping 
              the Adorians, an alien race that is part of a war that is making its way to Earth, Agent O has no 
              choice but to deputize Peter into helping retrieve the book.</p>

        <p>At a party in Chauncey's rooftop penthouse for his new program "C-YA", C manages to keep Chauncey 
            occupied long enough for Peter to slip into Chauncey's study and steal the book. While there they
             find confirmation that Chauncey is indeed in some sort of partnership with the Adorians and that he 
             somehow turned J and K into statues. Peter and C take the book to Professor Thurgood, a curator at 
             the New York Museum of History who had Peter fired because of his theories. C tells Peter that 
             Thurgood is actually an alien, which angers him due to the fact that he was holding information about
              himself out on him. Peter is further enraged when Thurgood pretends to know nothing about the Book 
              of Khnemu even though evidence around his study says otherwise. However, before they can get any real 
              answers out of him, the Adorians break in and steal the book back. The two follow them to Chauncey's 
              New Mexico mansion where they discover a downed Adorian ship trapped in a mountain, which explains how 
              Chauncey contacted the Adorians in the first place.
